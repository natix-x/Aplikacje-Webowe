        <h2 id="biography-section">Short biography</h2>
        <p>
          Caravaggio (Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio) was born on September
          29, 1571, in Milan. His father was a master builder who worked for the
          noble Sforza family. When Caravaggio was only six years old, his
          father passed away, and a few years later, he also lost his mother.
          After these tragic events, he moved to the nearby town of Caravaggio,
          from which he later took his name. As a teenager, Caravaggio began
          studying painting under the Milanese artist Simone Peterzano, who had
          been a student of Titian. His time with Peterzano exposed Caravaggio
          to the mannerist style and Renaissance traditions, but it was in Rome
          where he truly found his artistic path. Upon arriving in Rome in the
          1590s, Caravaggio lived in poverty, painting small commissions such as
          portraits and still lifes of flowers and fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, his unique style – realistic, dramatic, and full of intense
          contrasts between light and shadow – soon caught the attention of
          Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte, a powerful patron. With the
          cardinal's support, Caravaggio gained the opportunity to paint larger
          works, including religious commissions. His paintings shocked many
          because they portrayed sacred figures with an unprecedented level of
          honesty and naturalism. Instead of idealized images, Caravaggio
          painted ordinary people – rough, dirty, and weary. For example, in The
          Calling of Saint Matthew, Christ and Saint Matthew are depicted in a
          dimly lit interior, and the play of light gives the scene an almost
          theatrical quality. This approach garnered both admiration and
          outrage. Critics accused him of blasphemy, and some of his works, like
          Death of the Virgin, were rejected by the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caravaggio was also known for his violent temper. He frequently got
          into fights, both on the streets and with other artists. In 1606,
          after one such brawl, he killed a man – reportedly over a tennis match
          dispute. He was sentenced to exile, and a bounty was placed on his
          head by the Roman authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          After committing murder in 1606, Caravaggio fled Rome to avoid
          execution. Seeking refuge, he first went to Naples and then to Malta,
          where he spent a significant period of his life. Malta, the stronghold
          of the Knights of Malta (the Sovereign Military Order of Malta), was
          an important cultural and religious center. Caravaggio hoped to find
          protection and rebuild his reputation there. On Malta, Caravaggio
          gained the favor of the Grand Master of the Order, Alof de Wignacourt,
          who was impressed by his talent. In 1608, Caravaggio was inducted as a
          knight of the Order of St. John, an immense honor for the artist. He
          painted several important works for the Order, including the
          monumental Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, considered one of his
          masterpieces. This painting is unique in that it bears Caravaggio’s
          only known signature, indicating how much he valued this work.
          However, Caravaggio’s time in Malta was also marked by turmoil. In
          October 1608, he got into another violent altercation, this time
          attacking a fellow knight. As a result, he was arrested and
          imprisoned. Remarkably, Caravaggio managed to escape from the Maltese
          fortress, which further complicated his situation and forced him to
          remain on the run.
        </p>
        <p>
          After fleeing Malta, Caravaggio traveled to Sicily, where he continued
          to work on various commissions. Yet, he lived in constant fear of
          being captured. Despite the hardships and the sense of impending doom,
          his paintings from this period became even more dramatic and dark,
          reflecting his inner turmoil. The Maltese episode was both a moment of
          great success and a profound failure for Caravaggio, as he was unable
          to escape his troubles despite his artistic achievements.

        <h2 id="style-section">Caravaggio style</h2>
        <p>
          Caravaggio, born Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, is a pivotal
          figure in the history of art, renowned for his revolutionary approach
          to painting during the Baroque period. His unique style is
          characterized by several key elements:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Realism:</strong> Caravaggio is celebrated for his
            unparalleled realism. He painted human figures with striking
            authenticity, eschewing idealization in favor of capturing the raw,
            unfiltered essence of his subjects. His characters often emerged
            from the streets, displaying a range of emotions and physical
            imperfections that rendered them relatable and human. This focus on
            everyday people and their experiences was a departure from the more
            stylized representations of earlier artistic traditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chiaroscuro:</strong> One of the hallmarks of Caravaggio's
            work is his masterful use of chiaroscuro—the technique of employing
            strong contrasts between light and shadow. This method creates a
            dramatic interplay of light that not only enhances the
            three-dimensionality of the figures but also evokes a sense of mood
            and emotion. Caravaggio's strategic placement of light draws the
            viewer's eye to specific elements of the composition, adding depth
            and intensity to the narrative.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Composition:</strong> Caravaggio's paintings often
            exhibit a dynamic quality, filled with movement and energy. He
            skillfully arranged his figures in ways that convey action and
            emotion, making the viewer feel as though they are part of the
            unfolding scene. His compositions frequently depict climactic
            moments, capturing the tension and drama of the narrative.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Theatricality:</strong> Many of Caravaggio's works have a
            theatrical quality, reminiscent of staged performances. The
            arrangement of figures, the use of dramatic lighting, and the
            intense expressions all contribute to a sense of drama. This
            theatricality invites viewers to engage with the artwork on a deeper
            emotional level, as they feel drawn into the story being told.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ordinary People in Sacred Narratives:</strong> Caravaggio
            revolutionized religious art by populating biblical scenes with
            ordinary individuals. He often portrayed saints and biblical figures
            with relatable human traits, depicting them in everyday settings.
            This approach made sacred stories more accessible and resonant for
            viewers, bridging the gap between the divine and the mundane.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Psychological Depth:</strong> Beyond the visual aspects,
            Caravaggio's works are rich in psychological depth. His characters
            often exhibit intense emotions, reflecting their inner struggles and
            conflicts. This emphasis on psychological realism was groundbreaking
            for his time and added a layer of complexity to his storytelling.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Caravaggio's innovative techniques and distinctive style had a
          profound influence on the development of Baroque art and the evolution
          of realism in painting. His legacy continues to inspire artists today,
          as he challenged conventions and redefined the boundaries of artistic
          expression. Through his dramatic narratives and compelling characters,
          Caravaggio remains a towering figure in the art world, embodying the
          power of visual storytelling.
